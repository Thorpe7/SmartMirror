This is my introduction to coding. 

The code itself is outdate and written at a low level without any object orientation. 

While this code works and can display working date, time, google calendar, and cnn news headlines, it ultimately is not ready for distribution. 

If pulled: env vars will need to be updated per user and google api token will need to be re-configured for any given user looking to display their calendar.
